          The Srikalahasti Temple is located in the town of Srikalahasti in Tirupati district in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. Siva in his aspect as Vayu is worshipped as Kalahasteeswara. The temple is also regarded as Rahu-Ketu kshetra and Dakshina Kailasam. According to regional tradition, it is said to be the site where Kannappa was ready to offer both his eyes to cover blood flowing from the Shivalinga before Shiva stopped him and granted him moksha.[3]

Srikalahasti temple, situated 36 km away from Tirupati, is famous for its Vayu Lingam (Wind Lingam), one of the Pancha Bhuta Sthalams, representing the wind. The temple is about 3Km from Sri Kalahasti(KHT) railway station. <br> <br>
In primordial times, the wind-god Vayu performed penance for thousands of years to the Karpoora Lingam, the lingam of Shiva made of camphor. Pleased with Vayu's penance, Shiva manifested before him and bestowed him three boons. Vayu was blessed to present everywhere in the world in form of air and want to be an integral part of every being in form of vayus. Further, The linga that Vayu worshipped was named as the Vayu Lingam after him and was declared to be worshipped by various beings.[4]

Another legend narrates that Shiva's consort Parvati adamantly asked him to teach her the secret of the Shiva Panchakshari Mantra. Angry with her behaviour, Shiva cursed her to discard her divine form and assume a human form. Parvati fell to the Earth. To atone, Parvati performed penance at Srikalahasti and pleased Shiva. Shiva granted her a heavenly body, a hundred times better than her previous divine form, apologised to her and later taught her the secret lore. Parvati is therefore worshipped as Gnana Prasunambika Devi in the temple.

Cursed to become a ghost, Ghanakala prayed at Srikalahasti for 15 years and after chanting the Bhairava Mantra, Shiva restored her original form. <br> <br>

Mayura, Chandra and Indra were cursed to become a spider, snake and elephant respectively. They sought atonement after taking bath in the river Swarnamukhi and praying at Srikalahasti.

Shiva appeared before the sage Markandeya in Srikalahasti and preached that a Guru alone could make esoteric teachings and, therefore he is Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.
